# Guidelines for Contributing Issues for the Trusted Tester for Web Training Course
First of all, **THANK YOU** for helping us make the Trusted Tester training better by identifying issues. We want to make the training as useful as possible, and your input will help us along that path. In order to help us keep things organized and get to the bottom of the issue as quickly as possible, we ask that you follow just a few guidelines, as outlined below.

## Use the Issue Template
When you open a new issue, you will see placeholder text in the comment field outlining the type of information we would generally like included in most issues. Of course, not all items apply to every issue, depending on the type of issue. Modify the content to include the information that makes the most sense for the issue. Nevertheless, generally we want you to report the following for issues:
* Issue type (system bug, typo/grammar, incorrect content, 508/accessibility issue
* Description of the issue
* Location (URL, Course Topic, Chapter, and Subchapter)
* Your obeservation vs. the expected behavior or recommendation
* Steps to reproduce the issue (e.g., for a system bug)

## Please don't ask general questions about the course or request assistance completing the course
This repository is intended for identifying issues that need to be corrected. We will analyze and prioritize issues as they are identified. This issue repository is **NOT** intended as a Q&A forum or method to request tutoring or other course assistance.
